Hi!

Currently, I am a 2nd year graduate student in the [Human Genetics (HGEN)](https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/igp/human-genetics/) department at Vanderbilt University, and I am in the lab of Tim Hohman, PhD., which is part of the [Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center](https://www.vumc.org/vmac/).

Currently, I am studying sex differences underlying resilience to Alzheimer's disease! I use computational genetics methods including genome-wide association studies (GWAS), gene-and pathway-based tests, and genetic correlation analyses. 

Coding languages that I use include: `R`, `Bash`, `Python`, and `PLINK` genetics software.

A fun fact about me is that I was a figure skater for 13 years!
